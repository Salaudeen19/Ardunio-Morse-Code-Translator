# Ardunio-Morse-Code-Translator
The Arduino Morse Code Translator is a simple yet functional project that converts Morse code input into readable English text. It uses a button to capture dot and dash inputs from the user, with each press corresponding to a Morse code character. The translated message is displayed on an LED screen, providing real-time output in english.
